---

This software was developed as a part of the Combustion course of the Mechanical Engineering undergraduate program at Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo (USP)

Its goal is to evalute the time needed for the explosion of tank containing a mix of combustible gas and oxygen, as well as evaluating temperature and pressure changes along the explosion process.
