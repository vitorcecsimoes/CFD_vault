# Adiabatic Flame Temperature
-----

This small piece of software perform the calculation of the adiabatic flame temperature of CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, C3H8, C4H10 and C5H12 for a range of phi between 0.25 and 2.20
In the cases where phi>1.00 the dissotiation of water and carbon dioxide is also considered.

The output of the program is a .txt file containing the data evaluated considering both the hipotesys of constant volume and constant pressure. The different results can then be compared for academic and teatching purposes
