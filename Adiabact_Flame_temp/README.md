# Adiabatic Flame Temperature
-----

This software was developed as a part of theCombustion course of the Mechanical Engineering undergraduate program at Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo (USP) and was latter modified to include other gases, a wider range of phi and the water and CO2 dissociation hypothesis.

This small piece of software perform the calculation of the adiabatic flame temperature of CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, C3H8, C4H10 and C5H12 for a range of phi between 0.25 and 2.20
In the cases where phi>1.00 the dissotiation of water and carbon dioxide is also considered.

The output of the program is a .txt file containing the data evaluated considering both the hipotesys of constant volume and constant pressure. The different results can then be compared for academic and teatching purposes
