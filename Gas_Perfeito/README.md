# Perfect Gas
---
This software was developed as a part of the Thermodynamics course of the Mechanical Engineering undergraduate program at Universidade de São Paulo (USP) and was latter improoved as a part of the Thermodynamics course from the Chemical Engineering undergraduate program at Universidade Federal de São Paulo (Unifesp)

It evaluates the density of ammonia and propane at a given pressure and temperature.

For academic purposes, three different approaches are used for the evaluation: Perfect gas; Beatti-Bridgeman's and Lee-Kesler's
